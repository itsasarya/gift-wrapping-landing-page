# Pack & Pearl - Gift Wrapping Service (Concept Project)

## Overview

Pack & Pearl is a single-page landing website designed as a **UI/UX and frontend concept** for a premium gift wrapping service.  
This is a **hypothetical business** created for portfolio purposes only.

The goal of this project was to design a calm, premium, and conversion-focused landing page using **only vanilla HTML and CSS**, without relying on frameworks or backend functionality.

---

## Project Goals

- Design a realistic service-based landing page
- Focus on layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- Avoid fake galleries or misleading content
- Keep the UI minimal, honest, and portfolio-safe
- Demonstrate clean HTML/CSS structure and design thinking

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Single-Page Structure

A single-page layout was chosen to keep the experience focused and frictionless, which is appropriate for local and service-based businesses.

### 2. No Gallery Section

Since no real work images exist, a traditional gallery was intentionally omitted.  
Instead, trust is built through:

- Clear service descriptions
- A transparent “How It Works” section
- Explicit trust points

### 3. Two-Column Process Section

The process section uses a two-column layout:

- Left: step-by-step flow
- Right: trust and quality indicators

This balances clarity with credibility and avoids a cluttered, instructional feel.

### 4. Content Width Constraint

A global `.container` system was used to control reading width and keep content centered on large screens, creating a calm, premium feel.

### 5. Honest Labeling

All contact-related content is clearly marked as **concept-only** to avoid misleading users or reviewers.
